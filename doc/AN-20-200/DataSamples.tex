\section{Data Samples}

The datasets used for the analysis presented in this note were collected using
the CMS detector during the period 2016-2018. Data was recorded at the
center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=13~TeV$ and a total of $137.4~fb^{-1}$ was collected
and reconstructed with the 10.2.18 version of the CMS software. The standard
CMS selection of good runs and luminosity sections was applied
(see table \ref{tab:GoldenJson}).

The analysis makes use of datasets which combine several High Level Trigger
(HLT) paths. The datasets used are shown in table \ref{tab:Datasets}, each
dataset contains in the order of hundreds of millions events. As an event
may trigger different HLTs it may be stored in multiple datasets simultaneously.
In order to prevent double counting an index list is built containing unique
references to events based on their run and event number.
