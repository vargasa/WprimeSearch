\section{Systematic Uncertainties}

The systematic uncertanties affecting the data vs. simulation correction factors
for the efficiencies of the lepton trigger and identification. The lepton
efficiencies are determined by the tag-and-probe method \cite{tagandprobe} for data as well as for
simulation. The systematic uncertainty is then given by the uncertainty of
the ratio of the efficiencies.

There are two kinds of systematic uncertainties: those that relay on shape-based
uncertainties and log-normal uncertainties that depend only on rate.

Lepton identification and HLT systematics are evaluated by moving up and down
the appropiate scale factor by its uncertainty \ref{CorrectionsOnMC}.

An uncertainty of $1.8\%$ is included due to the measurement of
the integrated luminosity. Lepton identification, HLT systematics,
pileup reweighting, and k-factors systematics are evaluated by
moving up and down the appropiate scale factor by its uncertainty.

Uncertainties from higher order contributions, have been applied
to DY samples by evaluating up and down the QCD and EWK k-Factors.
