\section{Uncertainties}

An uncertainty of $1.8\%$ is included due to the measurement of
the integrated luminosity.

The systematic uncertanties affecting the data vs. simulation correction factors
for the efficiencies of the lepton trigger and identification. The lepton
efficiencies are determined by the tag-and-probe method for data as well as for
simulation. The systematic uncertainty is then given by the uncertainty of
the ratio of the efficiencies.
