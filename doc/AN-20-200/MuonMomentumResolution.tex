\section{Muon Momentum Resolution}

High-Pt muons ($>200GeV$) suffer from high energy loss by travelling in Iron
(material between different muon subdetectors) due to radiative processes. The
transverse momentum measurement relays on sagita ($s \propto 1/Pt$) which is associated
with the number of hits (tracker+muon). As the number of hits is lower in
tracker muons (only tracker hits+muon1st station) a study is needed to determine
the resolution of this Pt measurement for tracker-HighPt ID muons.

We can define the momentum resolution by defining the following difference:

\begin{equation}
\frac{P_{GEN}}{P_{RECO}} - 1 = \frac{\dfrac{1}{P_{RECO}}-\dfrac{1}{P_{GEN}}}{\dfrac{1}{P_{RECO}}}
\end{equation}

the closer to zero, the better the resolution.
